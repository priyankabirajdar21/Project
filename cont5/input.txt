There are similarities between a family and a society. In a family, parents look after their children that is their day-to-day and future well-being. If every member in a family looks after his own interests alone there can be no peace and nothing will get done. For example, when boarding a train or a bus, we must rule and maintain order and discipline so that nobody can complain against another person. If we allow first the passengers to get down. If we try to force our way in and those who want to get down try to honor othersâ€™ rights, others will be compelled to honor our own. Give and take, live and let live- these are the rules of decent survival in this world.
