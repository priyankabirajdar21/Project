Environment means a healthy natural balance in the air, water, animals, plants, and other natural resources. But today all over the world this environment is being poisoned in a number of ways. The constant more in the world population is the main reason for environmental pollution. More population means more industry. Factories release toxic gases into the air, filthy poisonous waters from factories and mills For also released into the waters of rivers; trees are cut down for fuel and other commercial purposes, or for procuring land for building houses. This results in the fall in the supply of oxygen that the trees provide With the felling of trees animals and birds also lose their shelter and this destroys the balance in the ecology. In the cities, poisonous gases like carbon monoxide are constantly emitted by trucks, buses, and cars that use petroleum products as sources of energy. Thus everywhere, whether in the cities or in the countryside environmental pollution has a deadly effect on all forms of life. Human beings suffer from various kinds of diseases like asthma, hypertension, different kinds of heart trouble, bronchitis, pleurisy, etc. Sound or noise pollution, especially in the cities, is caused by the hooting of cars and buses, playing music over the loudspeakers also subject people to another kind of environmental pollution. To prevent these hazards from endangering human, animal, and plant life measures should be taken before the situation goes out of control. More trees should be planted. Anti-pollution scientific methods should be devised.
