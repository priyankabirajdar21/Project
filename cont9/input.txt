Science has done wonders in present-day civilization. It has made human life easy and comfortable In ancient days the man had to depend solely on the mercy of nature and in then society manpower was the only source for doing any laborious work. As time passed, man invented new appliances and applied new techniques to do things in every walk of life. Man has now entered the atomic era. Today he has been able to penetrate many of the mysteries of space. In some countries of the West, science has developed human society to an unimaginable extent. We cannot manufacture today even a small needle without having recourse to science. It saves both labor and time. Railways, trams, buses, ships, and airplanes have made journeys easier and quicker. Again, radios, wireless, telephones, fax, television, computer help the spread of knowledge in no time. Science has worked miracles in the branch of medicine, though its task is not yet complete. However, the achievements of science are not an unmixed blessing. As it has rid mankind of many evils, it has also created new problems and posed fresh dangers for man. Nowadays the great powers of the world always take pride in their achievements in the development of atomic weapons and threaten the world with unprecedented dangers. World peace is at stake. Unless scientific inventions are widely used for the benefit of mankind and civilization with a mission of peace and progress, they will eventually destroy the civilization that has been built up over such a long time and with such hard work. The devastations caused by the atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki towards the end of the Second World War make us shudder at the destructive power of science when misused by power-loving politicians.
