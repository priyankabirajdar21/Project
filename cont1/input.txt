Those of us who found out early that our teacher would be Mr. Fine shuddered to think of having to spend an entire year in his classroom, trapped and subjected to months of unending terror. We’d heard stories. We knew. Then a month before school was to begin, a list mysteriously surfaced showing the names of all the sixth-grade students at Fairmont Elementary, their teachers, and their classrooms. Normally such information wasn’t known until the first week of classes, but John Patrick’s mother was a secretary at the school, and somehow this list appeared. It didn’t matter how it was found, or who exactly leaked the information. It was that cold list of names that would cause a couple of dozen eleven-year-olds to panic. But as it turns out, we were all wrong about Mr. Fine. Theo’s day began with a shock. As soon as he arrived at the office that morning, he learned that his best friend was dead. Wasn’t it just twelve hours ago that they were eating chicken wings and tipping back beer in front of a baseball game at the Cooper’s Bar and Grill? After a long day of crunching numbers at the office, they stopped at a bar for a Thursday afternoon happy hour. They saw a few coworkers there, and before they knew it, it was closing time. Bill got in a car with someone he met just that evening and that was the last time Theo saw him.
